Hello! . output explored . There are several ways to ouput the classic introduction message: &quot;Hello, World!&quot; . Before you go further, open Console on your Browser. JavaScript developer leaves Console open all the time!!! | The function console.log() outputs to Console, this is often used for inspection or debugging. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. Developer call this a hard coded string. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; literal is a parameter to console.log(), element.txt() and alert(). | The element.txt function is part of Jupyter Notebook %%js magic. This is convenient for Notebook and testing. | The alert command outputs the parameter to a dialog box, so you can see it in this Jupyter notebook. The alert commands are shown, but are commented out as the stop run all execution of the notebook. | Note, in a Web Application Debugging: An alert is often used for less savy Developers. Console is used by more savy developers; console often requires setting up a lot of outputs. Source level debugging is the most powerful solution for debugging and does not require alert or console commands. | . %%js // required to allow cell to be JavaScript enabled console.log(&quot;JavaScript/Jupyter Output Intro&quot;); // Browser Console output; debugging or tracing console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); console.log(&quot;Hello, World Again!&quot;); // Document Object Model (DOM) output; output to HTML, CSS which is standard for a Web Page // &lt;mark&gt;select element method&lt;/mark&gt;: DOM native JavaScript get, document.getElementByID document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // &lt;mark&gt;jQuery CSS-style method&lt;/mark&gt;: Tag for DOM selector, $(&#39;#output&#39;) $(&#39;#output&#39;).append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); // br is break or new line, b is bold // Jupyter built in magic element for testing and convenience of development element.text(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // element is output option as part of %%js magic element.append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); //alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . multiple outputs using one variable . This second example is a new sequence of code, two or more lines of code forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, thank goodness!!! In the previous example we were typing the string &quot;Hello, World&quot; over and over. Observe with the variable msg=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;; we type the string once and now use msg over and over. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console, be sure to Inspect it! | The element.text() is part of Jupyter Notebooks and displays as output blow the code on this page.

This example passes the defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are multiple steps in this code.. The &quot;definition of the function&quot;: &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. Passing a parameter is required when you call this function. | The &quot;call to the function:&quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually runs the function. The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used a parameter when calling the logIt function. | . | Showing reuse of function...

JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data.

            "content": "Setting up Machines with Conda Scripts . GitHub . What is GitHub? Github is a digital portfolio for storing collaboration. | Why do we use GitHub? Why not Google Drive or messages? Github is built specificly for coding. | What&#39;s the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a tool that manage multiple version of source code and github is a application. | Name as many Git commands as you can: Push, pull, sync, and merge. | . Two Main Machines . Which is better, MacOS or Windows? Windows is better because it&#39;s compatiable with more extensions. | Give some differences between MacOS and Windows in terms of the development we use in APCSP: They have different command in command prompt. | If you are on Windows, you want to skip the MacOS Setup instructions. | . Our Tools: . What is the first tool you remember installing? Vs code | Why was installations so hard the first time? Because the machine was not setup for programming and there were some incompatibility. | Without looking back at previous notes, name three tools you remember installing. This can be kernels, extensions, any installation for APCSP, and also write why it is needed. jupyter, python, javascript, bash. | . Actual Installations: . Tool setup is a week 0 thing. You should already have the knowledge to set up your machine. There is also a high chance you had to remove your environments and set up your machine again due to errors. If, for some reason, these don&#39;t apply to you, go here to set up your machine, here to check everything working with Bash, and here for Docker setup, which are the main tools on our machine needed to develop in APCSP. . MacOS Conda Scripts . After installing Homebrew, VSCode, and Python2, you&#39;ll need to run these Homebrew commands: . brew list # list packages brew update # update package list brew upgrade # upgrade packages brew install git # install latest git brew install python # install python3 for development python --version # version of python3 installed brew install java # openjdk install . Windows Conda Scripts . To get set up, run these commands: . wsl --install wsl --list wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04 # restart machine wsl cd ~ mkdir vscode ls cd ~/vscode # changes the directory to path for vscode files git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP.git # clone repo cd APCSP # changes the directory to path for APCSP repos assets code . # opens APCSP in VSCode cd .. # changes the directory to the previous/parent directory git config --global user.email mygmail@gmail.com # tell git your email git config --global user.name mygithub # tell git your github id shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.email your@email.here shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.name yourusernamehere # restart machine PS C: Users UserName&gt; wsl # Windows prompt to WSL command cd /tmp wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh chmod +x Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # Answer yes to all the prompts ./Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # run apt package commands now sudo apt list # list packages sudo apt update # update package list sudo apt upgrade # upgrade packages sudo apt install python2 # install python2 for package dependencies sudo apt install python3 python3-pip # install python3 and pip3 for development python --version # version of python3 should be shown sudo apt install default-jdk default-jre # java install java --version # java runtime version javac --version # java compiler version sudo apt install unzip # unzip utility . Setting Up Kernels . Now that you have everything installed on MacOS/Windows, we need to get kernels installed so that we can develop inside Fastpages notebooks. To do that, run these commands on both MacOS and Windows: . (base) id:~$ conda --version (base) id:~$ conda install jupyter # install jupyter (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list installed kernels Available kernels: python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ # start in home directory (base) id:~$ pip install bash_kernel # download bash kernel Collecting bash_kernel Downloading bash_kernel-0.7.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl (15 kB) Requirement already satisfied: pexpect&gt;=4.0 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from bash_kernel) (4.8.0) Requirement already satisfied: ptyprocess&gt;=0.5 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from pexpect&gt;=4.0-&gt;bash_kernel) (0.7.0) Installing collected packages: bash-kernel Successfully installed bash-kernel-0.7.2 (base) id:~$ python -m bash_kernel.install # install kernel Installing IPython kernel spec (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ conda install nodejs # node is framework for JavaScript kernel (base) id:~$ npm -version # node package manager comes with nodejs (base) id:~$ npm install -g ijavascript # get the kernel (base) id:~$ ijsinstall # install javascript kernel (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash javascript /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/javascript python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 . By now, you should already know how to clone Git repositories into your VSCode directory. Once you do that, you&#39;re all set for developing with GitHub Pages and Fastpages! . Before We Set Up Pages, A Guide to Git . As we&#39;ve discussed, Git is different from GitHub. Because GitHub is merely the place where we store Git repos, we use Git&#39;s commands to help us get, open, and configure these repositories. Here are some of the Git commands you should be using a lot (In the comments, tell what each Git command does): . git clone {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? # it clone a github repository to vscode so you can commit. git checkout [branch] # what does it do? # Switch branches or restore working tree files git fork {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? # a copy of an existing repository in which the new owner disconnects the codebase from previous committers. git commit -m {&quot;commit-msg&quot;} # what does it do? # It commit the changes so you can sync it git pull # what does it do? # It pull the updated data frem github git push # what does it do? # It push your change to github # After this line, name other commands that you can use and what they do. This should be easy, as you&#39;ve already answered the qeue # We could also use git merge that merge branches and changes. . Setting Up GitHub Pages . Some of you may have come to know that GitHub Pages is starting to become outdated. So why do we still use it? The answer is that we are in a class, and following a curriculum with something like GitHub Pages is much easier than creating portfolio content from scratch, which becomes quite unecessary. Therefore, we can use GitHub Pages to create this content instead. On the topic of unecessary vs necessary coding, we don&#39;t need to make GitHub Pages from scratch as opposed to using a template that our very own Mr. Mortensen created for us. To do that, we can go to the Leuck Reunion repository and use the template to make our own GitHub Pages. Then, in Ubuntu, we can git clone our repository and open it in VSCode. After we have it open, the last thing we want to do is set up local hosting for this website, so that we can preview it and make changes in real time. To do that, head here to install Jekyll for Ubuntu, here to install Ruby next, and here to finalize the process by installing Bundler. . Setting Up FastPages . In Setting Up Github Pages, we talked about how it is easier to use a template to create portfolio content. It is also easier to use a template when creating the portfolio itself. To do that, we can use Fastpages, which is what we have been using to show our blogs, code, and projects. However, Fastpages has been deprecated for some time now, so the instructions in Week 0 won&#39;t be effective. So, we need to fork the APCSP Fastpages. To do that, follow this video to get started developing with Fastpages. . Hacks . Show how you incorporate three tools that we have installed into your project. 0.1 points for each feature. (0.3).

            "content": "Introduction . Frontend and backend are two essential components of a web application. The frontend is the part of the application that interacts with the user, whereas the backend is the part that handles the logic and data processing behind the scenes. . The frontend, also known as the client-side, typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that runs in the user&#39;s web browser. The frontend handles the user interface, page layout, and overall look of the application. It also handles user interactions, such as submitting forms, clicking buttons, and navigating between pages. . On the other hand, the backend, also known as the server-side, typically consists of a server, a database, and, in our case, APIs. The backend handles the processing and storage of data, manages user authentication and authorization, and handles business logic and rules. The backend also communicates with the frontend, providing the necessary data to render the user interface and processing user inputs. . Backend . In our class we mainly use Python and SQL/JSON to create APIs and databases. Here is a simple example of creating a SQL database and using CRUD as well. . What is CRUD . C: The &#39;C&#39; stands for create, meaning to create a new entry in a database. In this case, creating a new entry about a certain movie or TV show. . | R: Read, or to retrieve data from the database. In this case it is selecting the movie/TV shwo that you choose to display. . | U: Update, or changing an existing entry in the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and changing the values to match what you want. . | D: Delete, or removing data from the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and removing the entry from the database. . | . Films API . This API is intended to be used as a list of movies and TV shows that a person has watched. It includes attributes for the Film name(key), the year released, the language, the number of episodes, A list of the number of episodes(using pickletype), and a youtube url for the trailer. The CRUD works as follows: Create: Enter the above mentioned attributes Read: Returns all of the films and their attributes Update: Takes in new episodes watched, and a list of their names, and adds them to their respective attibutes Delete: Option for deleting every film, also takes in a name to delete that film if it exists . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;films.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, year INTEGER, epcount INTEGER, language TEXT, trailer TEXT, eplist TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database and close the connection conn.commit() conn.close() . import sqlite3 def create(): # Ask the user for movie details title = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show title: &quot;) year = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show release year: &quot;) epcount = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show epcount: &quot;) language = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show language: &quot;) eplist = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show episode names: &quot;) trailer = input(&quot;Enter the link movie/tv show trailer: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands database = &#39;films.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO movies (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{title} has been added to the list of movies.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record:&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . inception has been added to the list of movies. . def read(id): # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands database = &#39;films.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() # Execute SQL to select a record from db by id cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM movies WHERE id=?&quot;, (id,)) # Fetch the record from the cursor movie = cursor.fetchone() # If movie exists, print its details, else print message if movie: print(f&quot;{movie[0]}. {movie[1]}, {movie[2]}, {movie[3]}, {movie[4]}, {movie[5]}, {movie[6]}&quot;) else: print(&quot;Movie not found.&quot;) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() read(id=1) . 1. inception, 2010, 1, English, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdI0JLVhdYc, no trailer . def update(id): # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands database = &#39;films.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() # Ask the user for movie details to update title = input(&quot;Enter the updated movie/tv show title: &quot;) year = input(&quot;Enter the updated movie/tv show release year: &quot;) epcount = input(&quot;Enter the updated movie/tv show epcount: &quot;) language = input(&quot;Enter the updated movie/tv show language: &quot;) eplist = input(&quot;Enter the updated movie/tv show episode names: &quot;) trailer = input(&quot;Enter the updated link movie/tv show trailer: &quot;) try: # Execute SQL to update the record in db cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE movies SET title=?, year=?, epcount=?, language=?, eplist=?, trailer=?

Movie deleted successfully. . Fetching . Overview . Involves retrieving data from a server or database | Can use different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, to perform different types of operations on the server. | Fetching can be done through a variety of ways including AJAX, XHR, and Axios | In APCSP we tend to use the Fetch API over anything else | Fetching involves sending a request to a server using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which identifies the location of the resource being requested. | Can receive data in various formats, including JSON | JSON data can be parsed into objects and arrays in JavaScript, making it easy to work with and manipulate in the frontend | . Python Fetch Using Request . import requests url = &quot;https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/titles&quot; headers = { &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;,

            "title": "Notebook - Data Related to User Guide",
            "content": "NOTE . As you follow along, make sure to fill in the blanks and complete the coding exercises! . Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application&#39;s performance. . For example, by storing a user&#39;s name and profile picture, the application can address the user by name and display their picture, creating a more personal experience. Activity logs can also be used to track user behavior and help the application recommend new features or improvements. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and responsibly, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build robust and user-friendly applications that meet the needs of your users. . For simplicity purposes, we will be lecturing on how one can store and manipulate user data for future utilization. . Here we go! . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . In the context of backend functionality, this class can be used to create, malipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user related request. . Creating a new user: . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: john_doe, Email: john@example.com . Lecture Topics: . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are template used to create object, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def init(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email . def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . Creating a new user: . python . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Here, we create a new User object, new_user, with a specified username and email. We then call the display_info method to display the user&#39;s information. . Using property decorators (getter and setter) . Property Decorators allow developers to access and modify instance data more concisely. The @property decorator creates a getter method, while the @attribute.setter decorator creates a setter method. . Example: . class Employee: def __init__(self, employee_id, name): self._employee_id = employee_id self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Employee class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . In the context of backend functionality, this Employee class can be used to model employees within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage employee data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify employee information in a controlled way. . Usage: . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . John Doe Jane Doe . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method . employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . In the context of backend functionality, the getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . CHECK: Explain the function of getters and setters in your own words. Getter is a method that allows you to access an attribute and setter is a method that allows you to set the value of an attribute. . class Car: def __init__(self, make, model, year): self._make = make self._model = model self._year = year @property def make(self): return self._make @make.setter def make(self, new_make): self._make = new_make @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . Take notes here on property decorators and the purpose they serve: @property decorator is a built-in decorator in Python for the property() function . Students can then practice creating instances of their Car class and using the getter and setter methods to access and modify the car attributes. . In the context of backend functionality, this Car class can be used to model cars within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage car data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify car information in a controlled way. . Overview . WE COVERED: In conclusion, we have covered essential concepts in object-oriented programming using Python, including: . Defining classes and creating objects Property decorators (getter and setter) Class methods and static methods Inheritance and method overriding Working with multiple objects and class attributes . These concepts provide a solid foundation for understanding how to model real-world entities using classes and objects in Python. By learning to work with classes, objects, and their methods, students can develop more efficient and modular code. . As students become more comfortable with these concepts, they can explore more advanced topics, such as multiple inheritance, abstract classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Additionally, they can apply these principles to practical projects like web development with Flask and SQLite, as discussed earlier. . Overall, mastering object-oriented programming will greatly enhance students&#39; ability to develop complex and maintainable software systems. . Databases and SQlite . SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is embedded within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite a great choice for small-scale applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t want to set up a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, which provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. By the end of this lesson, you&#39;ll have a good understanding of how to work with SQLite databases in Flask and be ready to start building your own . . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . One of the key features of Flask is its ability to work seamlessly with databases, including SQLite. A database is a collection of data stored in an organized manner that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. . SQlite databse in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;example.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE example_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Basic SQL commands (create, read, update, delete) . SQL is really useful because it helps people do a bunch of things with the data stored in databases. For example, they can use it to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . CRUD is an acronym that stands for the fundamental operations that can be performed on a database, which are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. A widely-used lightweight database management system is SQLite, which can be easily integrated with different programming languages. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command . | . Take notes here on the basic components of SQL: . import sqlite3 def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu . This block of code is a menu function that helps with create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks and displays the schema. The menu function acts as a control point that directs the program to call different functions based on what the user wants to do. When users enter their preferred action, the input is checked to see which function to use. The menu function is created with no arguments and is called repeatedly, displaying the menu options until the user decides to leave. . Creating a Database . import sqlite3 def create_database(): # Connect to the database (will create it if it doesn&#39;t exist) connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Create the professors table if it doesn&#39;t already exist cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS professors ( name TEXT, field TEXT, rating REAL, reviews TEXT )&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit changes and close the connection connection.commit() connection.close() # Call the function to create the database create_database() . Create Function: . import sqlite3 def create(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; name = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s name: &quot;) field = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s field of expertise: &quot;) rating = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s rating (out of 10): &quot;) reviews = input(&quot;Enter any reviews or comments about the professor: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO professors (name, field, rating, reviews) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, field, rating, reviews)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been added to the list of coding professors.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . p has been added to the list of coding professors. . The insert function allows users to input information about a coding professor and store it in a SQLite database named &#39;professors.db&#39;. This script prompts the user for the professor&#39;s name, field of expertise, rating out of 10, and any reviews or comments about the professor. It then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . Read Function . import sqlite3 def read(): try: # Open a connection to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all records from the professors table cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors&quot;) rows = cursor.fetchall() # If there are any records, print them if len(rows) &gt; 0: print(&quot;List of coding professors:&quot;) for row in rows: print(f&quot;Name: {row[0]} nField of expertise: {row[1]} nRating: {row[2]} nReviews: {row[3]} n&quot;) else: print(&quot;There are no coding professors in the list.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while connecting to the database:&quot;, error) finally: # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() read() . List of coding professors: Name: p Field of expertise: p Rating: p Reviews: p . This code demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using Python and the sqlite library. The first step is to establish a connection to the database and create a cursor object to execute SQL commands. Then, a SELECT query is executed to fetch all records from the &quot;professors&quot; table. If there are any records, the code iterates through each record and prints out the name, field of expertise, rating, and reviews for each coding professor. If there are no records in the table, a message indicating so is printed. . Update Function . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Get the professor&#39;s name to update name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor to update: &quot;) # Retrieve the current record from the database cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) record = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor is found, update the record if record: print(&quot;Enter the new information for the professor:&quot;) field = input(f&quot;Current field: {record[1]} nNew field: &quot;) rating = input(f&quot;Current rating: {record[2]} nNew rating: &quot;) reviews = input(f&quot;Current reviews: {record[3]} nNew reviews: &quot;) # Execute SQL to update the record cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE professors SET field=?, rating=?, reviews=? WHERE name=?&quot;, (field, rating, reviews, name)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name}&#39;s record has been updated.&quot;) # If the professor is not found, notify the user else: print(f&quot;No record found for {name}.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while updating record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update () . Enter the new information for the professor: p&#39;s record has been updated. . This is an implementation of an update function for the professors database using the sqlite3 module in Python. The function first establishes a connection to the database file &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; and creates a cursor object to execute sql commands. It prompts the user to enter the name of the professor to update and retrieves the corresponding record from the database using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to match the professor&#39;s name. If the professor is found in the database, the user is prompted to enter new information for the professor&#39;s field of expertise, rating, and reviews. The function then executes an UPDATE statement with the new information to update the record in the database. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): # Connect to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Prompt the user for the name of the professor to delete name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor you want to delete: &quot;) # Use a SQL query to find the professor with the given name cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) row = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor exists, confirm deletion and delete the record if row: confirm = input(f&quot;Are you sure you want to delete {name}? (y/n): &quot;) if confirm.lower() == &#39;y&#39;: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been deleted from the list of coding professors.&quot;) else: print(f&quot;{name} not found in the list of coding professors.&quot;) # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . This code is a Python function for deleting a record from a SQLite database. The function prompts the user to input the name of the professor they want to delete. It then uses a SQL query to search for the professor in the database. If the professor is found, the user is prompted to confirm the deletion. If the user confirms, the function executes a SQL command to delete the record from the database. The function also prints a message confirming that the professor has been deleted from the list of coding professors. If the professor is not found in the database, the function prints a message indicating that the professor is not in the list. . Our Project ... in the works . SAM Messaging System . HACKS .

I see addition. | I also see division. | . grade1 = 10 grade2 = grade1 average_grade = (grade1 + grade2) // 2 #what are these two slashes? print(average_grade) . 10 . What is the value of num1, num2, and num3? Explain how each number ended up what it was. . The value of num1 is 4096, it&#39;s the num3 power of num2. | The value of num2 is 455, it&#39;s num1 mod 5. | The value of num3 is 1, it&#39;s the floor division. | . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 ** num3 num3 = num1 % 5 num2 = (num1 + num3) // 9 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . 4096 455 1 . Selection . Selection refers to the process of making decision in a program based on certain conditions. It is normally done with conditional statements. . Conditionals . What is a conditional?: . Statement that allows code to execute different instructions if a certain condition is false | Allows program to make decisions based on data and input | . What are the main types of conditional statements?: . if | elif | else | . If statements . The if statement is used to check if a certain condition is true. The condition can be any expression that evaulates to a boolean value, True or False. If the condition is True, then it executes a code block. | If (condition) then (consequence) | Example: | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met . x is positive . Else . The else statemnt executes a code block when the if condition is False. | If (condition) then (consequence A), else (consequence B) | . Elif . The elif statement can check multiple conditions in a sequence, and execute a certain block of code if any of the conditions are true. | If (condition) then (consequence A), elif (condition) then (consequence B), else (consequence C) . | Example adding onto the code from before to take negative numbers and 0 into account . | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met elif x &lt; 0: # if previous condition not true... elif condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is negative&quot;)# code that will execute if condition is met else: # everything else, in this case it is if x == 0 print(&quot;x is zero&quot;) # only executes if all previous conditions are not met . x is positive . Nested Conditionals . What is a nested conditional?: . Conditional statement inside another conditional statement | Allows to check for more complex condition where one condition depends on another | . Nested Conditional Statements . Example | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x % 2 == 0: print(&quot;x is even divisible by 2&quot;) # only ever checks is x is divisble by 3 if x is even. nested conditional if x % 3 == 0: print(&quot;x is divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is odd&quot;) . x is odd . Indentation . When using conditionals and nested conditionals in Python, it is important to pay attention to the level in the code. The code inside the if, elif, and else blocks must be indented so they are nested wihtin the outer statements. This way, Python knows which code belongs to which block. . Binary Search . What is binary search and what is it used for?: . Searching algorithm | Find and select a specific element in a sorted list of elements | . How does binary search work?: . Repeatedly divides the search interval in half to find the middle element and compares the middle value to the target value, if not the same then it continues on to either the lower or upper half | Eliminate half of the remaining search interval elements each time | Efficient way to search for element in large dataset | . What is the time complexity and why?: . O(log(N)) | The maximum number of iterations is the amount of times the list can be divided in half until it reaches 1 number | Dividing by 2, so it is log2(N), logarigthm of n base 2 . | You may recognize the example below from the binary lesson last Friday . | . import random def binary_search_game(): low = 1 high = 100 target = random.randint(low, high) while True: guess = (low + high) // 2 print(f&quot;Is your number {guess}?&quot;) response = input(&quot;Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: &quot;) # conditional statements to check target number and guess if response == &#39;yes&#39;: print(f&quot;I guessed your number {guess}!&quot;) break elif response == &#39;higher&#39;: low = guess + 1 elif response == &#39;lower&#39;: high = guess - 1 else: print(&quot;Invalid input, please enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;.&quot;) binary_search_game() . Is your number 50? Is your number 75? I guessed your number 75! . Quick Hack . Write a program using conditionals and nested conditionals . Ideas: Quiz, game (rock paper scissors, guess number), etc | . import random user_choice = input(&quot;Enter (rock, paper, scissors): &quot;) choices = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;] computer_choice = random.choice(choices) print(f&quot;You chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.&quot;) if user_choice == computer_choice: print(f&quot;Both players selected {user_choice}. It&#39;s a tie!&quot;) elif user_choice == &quot;paper&quot;: if computer_choice == &quot;rock&quot;: print(&quot;You lost&quot;) else: print(&quot;You lost&quot;) elif user_choice == &quot;rock&quot;: if computer_choice == &quot;scissors&quot;: print(&quot;You win&quot;) else: print(&quot;You lost&quot;) elif user_choice == &quot;scissors&quot;: if computer_choice == &quot;paper&quot;: print(&quot;You win&quot;) else: print(&quot;You lose&quot;) . You chose paper, computer chose rock. You lost . Introduction to Algorithms . an algorithm is a set of instructions that describes how to solve a problem or perform a specific task using a computer program. | It is a precise sequence of computational steps that take an input and produce an output | . How do Algorithms relate to data structures? . Algorithms often rely on specific data structures to solve problems efficiently. | Sorting algorithms require a data structure such as an array or a linked list to store and manipulate data. | Searching algorithms such as binary search require data structures like array to organize and search through data. | . Important Terms . What is an algorithm? . it is a finite set of instructions that accomplishes a specific task | . Sequencing . means that there is an order in which to do things | . Selection . Helps to choose two different outcomes based off of a decision that the programmer wants to make | . Iteration . Repeat something until the condition is met. (also referred to as repetition) | . Calling and Developing Procedures . A procedure is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task. | To call a procedure, you need to know its name and any arguments it requires. | When a procedure is called, the program jumps to its instruction and starts executing it. | The arguments passed to a procedure can be used within the procedure to perform task or calculations. | After the procedure has completed its task, it returns control back to the calling program. | . def add_numbers(a, b): sum = a + b print(&quot;The sum of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;is&quot;, sum) # Call the procedure with arguments 5 and 7 add_numbers(5, 7) . The sum of 5 and 7 is 12 . The result of the procedure can be stored in variable, printed to the screen, or used in any other way that is required by the program. | Procedures can be defined within the same program defined, and can be reused across multiple parts of the program. | To avoid errors and improve code readability, it&#39;s important to define and call procedures with proper syntax and conventions that are appropriate for the programming language you&#39;re using. | . def calculate_average(numbers): total = sum(numbers) count = len(numbers) average = total / count return average # Call the procedure with a list of numbers numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] result = calculate_average(numbers_list) # Display the result print(&quot;The average of&quot;, numbers_list, &quot;is&quot;, result) . The average of [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] is 30.0 . Algorithmic Efficiency . Algorithmic efficiency refers to the amount of time and resource needed to execute an algorithm. | The efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in terms of its complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | can be analyzed using Big O anitation, which provides an upper bound on the worst-case time and space complexity of the algorithm. | . | . What is the time complexity of the following code: . O(N) | O(N*log(N)) | O(N * Sqrt(N)) | O(N*N) | . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i, N)): a = a + i + j . What will be the time complexity of the following code? . n | (n+1) | n(n-1) | n(n+1) | . value = 0 for i in range(n): #iterates &quot;n&quot; times, with &quot;i&quot; taking on values from 0 to n-1. for j in range(i): # iterates &quot;i&quot; times, with &quot;j&quot; taking on values from 0 to i-1. value=value+1 . Efficiency can be improved by optimizing algorithms or by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. Some common techniques for improving efficiency include reducing the size of input data, caching results, and parallelizing tasks. | Understanding algorithmic efficiency is important in software development, as it can impact the performance of applications and their ability to scale with larger data sets. | . | . Iteration and Simulations . Simulations are models of real-world phenomena or systems that use mathematical algorithms and computer programs simulate the real behavior and aspects of the subject being modeled. . Simulations are most often used to model complex or time-consuming thing that would be difficult to test in real life, such as modeling the spread of diseases in certain ecosystems or testing the functionality of a potential product before it is made. . In this lesson, we will be looking at lists, iteration, and random values through the lens of simulations. . PLEASE RUN THE CODE BELOW BEFORE INTERACTING WITH THE CODE SEGMENTS IN THIS SECTION! . class Card: def __init__(self, suit, val): self.suit = suit self.val = val if val == 11: self.kind = &quot;Ace&quot; elif val == 12: self.kind = &quot;Jack&quot; elif val == 13: self.kind = &quot;Queen&quot; elif val == 14: self.kind = &quot;King&quot; else: self.kind = str(self.val) #return a formatted string version of a card def show(self): return f&quot;{self.kind} of {self.suit}&quot; #adjust aces to prevent breaking def ace_adj(self): if self.kind == &quot;Ace&quot;: self.val = 1 . Review: Lists and Iteration . Lists and iteration work hand-in-hand to efficiently process and/or modify multiple values at once. In a card game, for example, lists and iteration are used together frequently to make the game work correctly. . For Loops . For loops are probably the most well-known type of iterative loop used in code. Most of us know about the for variable in list format. . One helpful tool not a lot of people know about is the enumerate() function. When used in conjunction with a for loop, you can always have access to the index and value of each selected list entry. . numlist = [3, 5, 68, 203] for key, num in enumerate(numlist): print(f&quot;This entry&#39;s index is {str(key)}, but its value is {str(num)}.&quot;) print(f&quot;The difference between the value and the index is {num - key}.&quot;) . This entry&#39;s index is 0, but its value is 3. The difference between the value and the index is 3. This entry&#39;s index is 1, but its value is 5. The difference between the value and the index is 4. This entry&#39;s index is 2, but its value is 68. The difference between the value and the index is 66. This entry&#39;s index is 3, but its value is 203. The difference between the value and the index is 200. . QUESTION: How is the key, num in enumerate(list) format similar to the format used when applying a for loop to a dictionary? . Answer: When using enumerate with a list, the unction assigns an index to each item in the list. The index can be accessed using the key. Similar as enumerate, when using a for loop, the key can be also accessed by the variable. . List Comprehension . You may also see for loops used within a list like below. We went over this in class fairly recently. In this case, it is used to show the cards in the hand of a player. . player_hand = [] # the player&#39;s hand is represented as a list # because lists are mutable (can change), they can be added to, like drawing a card # assume the deck below is a a deck of shuffled cards deck = [Card(&quot;Hearts&quot;, 3), Card(&quot;Spades&quot;, 12), Card(&quot;Diamonds&quot;, 11)] def draw_card(hand, deck): hand.append(deck.pop()) #try it out draw_card(player_hand, deck) print([card.show() for card in player_hand]) . [&#39;Ace of Diamonds&#39;] . Recursive Loops . Recursive loops have you calling one function inside of another. If a function must make some change to a certain value multiple times, it is oftem most efficient to have a function call itself with slightly different arguments like the fibonacci sequence below. . def fibonacci(terms): if terms &lt;= 1: return terms return fibonacci(terms-1) + fibonacci(terms-2) fibonacci(10) . 55 . Nesting Loops . Nesting loops increases the time complexity of the program, but it can be used to do things like make a card deck (see below). . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): #HINT: try replacing this function deck.append(Card(suit, val)) . While Loops . While loops aren&#39;t used in the program, but they offer a different way to repeat a set of instructions in a program. The procedure below the while [condition] line will occur until the condition is made not true. . Student Interaction: How could this build function be altered to function with a while loop within it? A while loop could be used to run only when val is in the range 1 and 15, like while val smaller than 15 and while val greater than 1. . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): deck.append(Card(suit, val)) #HINT: you may want to make an incrementing i variable . While loops also alter an alternative way to loop a set of instructions forever, until a precise thing occurs to break the loop. See the code below. . import random i = 0 while True: i += 1 ch = random.randint(1, 11) if ch == 10: print(f&quot;It took {str(i)} random generations to get 10.&quot;) break . It took 12 random generations to get 10. . 49 random generations is a lot more than it would normally take, but it&#39;s important for code to be able to model unlikely, yet possible scenarios. Speaking of random values... . Random Values . Because unpredictable randomness occurs in the real world, it&#39;s important to have a way to represent it. Simulations are able to use randomization, which could be in the form of random number generation or other methods like shuffle. . Card decks are a great example of how random values can be used to represent real-world scenarios. In the card simulation, the random module&#39;s shuffle function is used to quite literally shuffle the deck, seen below. . def shuffle(deck): random.shuffle(deck) . Often, random selection methods use functions like randint or randrange as ways to select certain indexes in lists, or might use the random numbers in some other way. . QUESTION: Without shuffling the card order of the deck, can you think of a way that the aforementioned random module functions could be used to get a random card from the deck? Do so in the code cell below. . Yes, we could use random choice to get a card from the deck. | . import random random_card = random.choice(deck) print(deck) #find another random function that could pull a random card from a deck of UNSORTED cards . &lt;__main__.Card object at 0x7ff070249d00&gt; . Simulation Homework . Now that you&#39;ve learned about simulations and how they&#39;re used, it&#39;s time to apply that knowledge by creating a (basic) simulation of a real-world scenario. It can be something in nature, like the changes in the wildlife population of a certain area; it can be a game, like Uno (no blackjack though, that&#39;s taken); or it can be something completely random and unique. . The simulation must include... . Use of at least one random value | At least one list or similar data type (dictionary, set, etc.) | Efficient use of iteration (must support the purpose of the simualtion) | Selection (use of conditionals) | . Do this in your student copy in the cell provided. This is worth 0.9 (or more with extra credit) out of the 3 possible points. . import random rolls = 100 times = {i: 0 for i in range(1, 15)} for i in range(rolls): num1 = random.randint(1, 6) num2 = random.randint(1, 6) total = num1 + num2 times[total] += 1 for i in range(1, 10): print(f&quot;out of {rolls} rolls, {i} appears {times[i]} times &quot;) . out of 100 rolls, 1 appears 0 times out of 100 rolls, 2 appears 5 times out of 100 rolls, 3 appears 3 times out of 100 rolls, 4 appears 9 times out of 100 rolls, 5 appears 11 times out of 100 rolls, 6 appears 15 times out of 100 rolls, 7 appears 22 times out of 100 rolls, 8 appears 8 times out of 100 rolls, 9 appears 10 times . Databases . We have already gone over databases in this class, but here is a refresher. A database contains data that&#39;s stored in columns and rows. The information in this database can then be pulled from the database and can be used in a program. . Setting Up the Database . Run the code cell below to prepare SQLite to create the database. If your system is struggling with the flask functions, verify that you&#39;re in the correct Python environment. REMEMBER: You should only db.init_app(app) ONCE during the process! . from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///sqlite.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) . The Model File . The model file plays a crucial role in the formation of the database. . The model helps to create new databases | It provides a standardized method for formating the database entries across different systems | Objects used within the database are created | . import os, base64 import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table class User(db.Model): __tablename__ = &#39;players&#39; # table name is plural, class name is singular # Define the User schema with &quot;vars&quot; from object id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) _username = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) _streak = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=True, nullable=False) # constructor of a User object, initializes the instance variables within object (self) def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._streak = streak # a username getter method, extracts username from object @property def username(self): return self._username # a setter function, allows username to be updated after initial object creation @username.setter def username(self, username): self._username = username # a getter method, extracts streak from object @property def streak(self): return self._streak # a setter function, allows streak to be updated after initial object creation @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak # output content using str(object) in human readable form, uses getter # output content using json dumps, this is ready for API response def __str__(self): return json.dumps(self.read()) # CRUD create/add a new record to the table # returns self or None on error def create(self): try: # creates a person object from User(db.Model) class, passes initializers db.session.add(self) # add prepares to persist person object to Users table db.session.commit() # SqlAlchemy &quot;unit of work pattern&quot; requires a manual commit return self except IntegrityError: db.session.remove() return None # CRUD read converts self to dictionary # returns dictionary def read(self): return { &quot;id&quot;: self.id, &quot;username&quot;: self.username, &quot;streak&quot;: self.streak } # CRUD update: updates user name, password, phone # returns self def update(self, username, streak): &quot;&quot;&quot;only updates values with length&quot;&quot;&quot; if len(username) &gt; 0: self.username = username if streak &gt; 0: self.streak = streak db.session.commit() return self # CRUD delete: remove self # None def delete(self): db.session.delete(self) db.session.commit() return None &quot;&quot;&quot;Database Creation and Testing &quot;&quot;&quot; # Builds working data for testing def initUsers(): with app.app_context(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create database and tables&quot;&quot;&quot; db.create_all() &quot;&quot;&quot;Tester data for table&quot;&quot;&quot; u1 = User(username=&quot;Mr. Cards&quot;, streak=5) u2 = User(username=&quot;Kard Kowntre&quot;, streak=10) u3 = User(username=&quot;Un Bea Table&quot;, streak=15) users = [u1, u2, u3] &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for user in users: try: user.create() print(f&#39;Created user with username &quot;{user.username}&quot;.&#39;) except IntegrityError: &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; db.session.remove() print(f&quot;Records exist, duplicate email, or error: {user.username}&quot;) . The init Fuction . The init method has one purpose which is to initialize the object&#39;s attributes. This is what is known as the constructor. In our project, the init method initalizes the username and streak as variables. . def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._score = streak . Setters and Getters . Setters and Getters are important methods used when writing code for databases. . Setter: a method that allows us to set or change the value of an attribute in a class. | Getter:a method that allows us to access an attribute in a given class. | . Setter Example . @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak . Getter Example . @property def streak(self): return self._streak . The Api File . An API is an important part of having a functional database. . it acts as a messenger that allows programs to access data from the others | it connects all information | for a database, an api retrives the data requested in code for the user | . import json from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building user_api = Blueprint(&#39;user_api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/users&#39;) api = Api(user_api) class UserAPI: class _CRUD(Resource): # User API operation for Create, Read. THe Update, Delete methods need to be implemeented def post(self): # Create method &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() &#39;&#39;&#39; Avoid garbage in, error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # validate name username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) if username is None or len(username) &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Username is missing, or is less than a character&#39;}, 400 # validate uid streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) if streak is None or streak &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Streak is missing, or is less than 1&#39;}, 400 &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; uo = User(username=username, streak=streak) &#39;&#39;&#39; #2: Key Code block to add user to database &#39;&#39;&#39; # create user in database user = uo.create() # success returns json of user if user: return jsonify(user.read()) # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {username}, either a format error or a duplicate&#39;}, 400 def get(self): # Read Method users = User.query.all() # read/extract all users from database json_ready = [user.read() for user in users] # prepare output in json return jsonify(json_ready) # jsonify creates Flask response object, more specific to APIs than json.dumps def put(self): body = request.get_json() # get the body of the request id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) # get the UID (Know what to reference) user = User.query.get(id) # get the player (using the uid in this case) user.update(username=username, streak=streak) return f&quot;{user.read()} Updated&quot; def delete(self): body = request.get_json() id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) player = User.query.get(id) player.delete() return f&quot;{player.read()} Has been deleted&quot; # building RESTapi endpoint api.add_resource(_CRUD, &#39;/&#39;) . This is important particularly in a full flask respository context, but in this case, you&#39;ll just need to run the initUsers() function. . initUsers() . An Alternative Method of Making SQLite Databases . In a previous lesson, we went over using the cursor object in SQLite3. Rather than go over all of that here, this lesson goes over it thoroughly. (You may use this method for the homework below.) . Database Homework . For this assignment, we&#39;d like you to make your own database file as instructed above. Remember, the API file isn&#39;t necessary in this case; you&#39;ll be focusing on making the model and the init function. . Your database must include these things: .

            "title": "Petite Pandas Data Analysis using Pandas and NumPy",
            "content": "Predictive Analysis . Predictive analysis is the use of statistical, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze current and historical data in order to make predictions about future events or behaviors. It involves identifying patterns and trends in data, and then using that information to forecast what is likely to happen in the future. . Predictive analysis is used in a wide range of applications, from forecasting sales and demand, to predicting customer behavior, to detecting fraudulent transactions. It involves collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including historical data, customer data, financial data, and social media data, among others. . The process of predictive analysis typically involves the following steps: . Defining the problem and identifying the relevant data sources | Collecting and cleaning the data | Exploring and analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends | Selecting an appropriate model or algorithm to use for predictions | Training and validating the model using historical data | Using the model to make predictions on new data | Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the model over time | Predictive analysis can help organizations make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive advantage by leveraging insights from data. . It is most commonly used in Retail, where workers try to predict which products would be most popular and try to advertise those products as much as possible, and also Healthcare, where algorithms analyze patterns and reveal prerequisites for diseases and suggest preventive treatment, predict the results of various treatments and choose the best option for each patient individually, and predict disease outbreaks and epidemics. . 1. Intro to NumPy and the features it consists . Numpy, by definition, is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python which can be used to perform mathematical operation, provide multidimensional array objects, and makes data analysis much easier. Numpy is very important and useful when it comes to data analysis, as it can easily use its features to complete and perform any mathematical operation, as well as analyze data files. . If you don&#39;t already have numpy installed, you can do so using conda install numpy or pip install numpy . Once that is complete, to import numpy in your code, all you must do is: . import numpy as np . 2. Using NumPy to create arrays . An array is the central data strucure of the NumPy library. They are used as containers which are able to store more than one item at the same time. Using the function np.array is used to create an array, in which you can create multidimensional arrays. . Shown below is how to create a 1D array: . a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) print(a) # this creates a 1D array . [1 2 3] . How could you create a 3D array based on knowing how to make a 1D array? . a = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]) print(a) . [[[1 2] [3 4]] [[5 6] [7 8]]] . Arrays can be printed in different ways, especially a more readable format. As we have seen, arrays are printed in rows and columns, but we can change that by using the reshape function . c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) print(c.reshape(1, 9)) # organizes it all in a single line of output . [[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]] . In the code segment below, we can also specially select certain rows and columns from the array to further analyze selective data. . print(c[1:, :2]) # the 1: means &quot;start at row 1 and select all the remaining rows&quot; # the :2 means &quot;select the first two columns&quot; . [[4 5] [7 8]] . 3. Basic array operations . One of the most basic operations that can be performed on arrays is arithmetic operations. With numpy, it is very easy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays. You can add, subtract, multiply and divide arrays, just like you would with regular numbers. When performing these operations, numpy applies the operation element-wise, meaning that it performs the operation on each element in the array separately. This makes it easy to perform operations on large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. . a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) b = np.array([4, 5, 6]) print(a + b) # adds each value based on the column the integer is in print(a - b) # subtracts each value based on the column the integer is in print(a * b) # multiplies each value based on the column the integer is in print(a / b) # divides each value based on the column the integer is in . [5 7 9] [-3 -3 -3] [ 4 10 18] [0.25 0.4 0.5 ] . d = np.exp(b) e = np.sqrt(b) print(d) print(e) . [ 54.59815003 148.4131591 403.42879349] [2. 2.23606798 2.44948974] . From the knowledge of how to use more advanced mathematical expressions than the basic 4 mathematical operations such as exponent and square root, now can you code how to calculate the 3 main trig expressions (sin, cos, tan), natural log, and log10 of a 1D array. . from math import e # calculate sin sin = np.sin(1) print(sin) # calculate cos cos = np.cos(1) print(cos) # calculate tan tan = np.tan(1) print(tan) # calculate natural log ln = np.log(e) print(ln) # calculate log10 log = np.log10(10) print(log) . 0.8414709848078965 0.5403023058681398 1.5574077246549023 1.0 1.0 . 4. Data analysis using numpy . Numpy provides a convenient and powerful way to perform data analysis tasks on large datasets. One of the most common tasks in data analysis is finding the mean, median, and standard deviation of a dataset. Numpy provides functions to perform these operations quickly and easily. The mean function calculates the average value of the data, while the median function calculates the middle value in the data. The standard deviation function calculates how spread out the data is from the mean. Additionally, numpy provides functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the data. These functions are very useful for gaining insight into the properties of large datasets and can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks. . data = np.array([2, 5, 12, 13, 19]) print(np.mean(data)) # finds the mean of the dataset print(np.median(data)) # finds the median of the dataset print(np.std(data)) # finds the standard deviation of the dataset print(np.min(data)) # finds the min of the dataset print(np.max(data)) # finds the max of the dataset . 10.2 12.0 6.04648658313239 2 19 . Now from learning this, can you find a different way from how we can solve the sum or products of a dataset other than how we learned before? . data = np.array([2, 5, 12, 13, 19]) print(np.sum(data)) . 51 . Numpy also has the ability to handle CSV files, which are commonly used to store and exchange large datasets. By importing CSV files into numpy arrays, we can easily perform complex operations and analysis on the data, making numpy an essential tool for data scientists and researchers. . genfromtxt and loadtxt are two functions in the numpy library that can be used to read data from text files, including CSV files. . genfromtxt is a more advanced function that can be used to read text files that have more complex structures, including CSV files. genfromtxt can handle files that have missing or invalid data, or files that have columns of different data types. It can also be used to skip header lines or to read only specific columns from the file. . import numpy as np padres = np.genfromtxt(&#39;files/padres.csv&#39;, delimiter=&#39;,&#39;, dtype=str, encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) # delimiter indicates that the data is separated into columns which is distinguished by commas # genfromtxt is used to read the csv file itself # dtype is used to have numpy automatically detect the data type in the csv file print(padres) .

Pandas . What is Pandas . Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. A python library is something It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. . Why Use Pandas? . Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories. Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant. Also it is a part of data analysis, and data manipulation. . What Can Pandas Do? . Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like: . Is there a correlation between two or more columns? | What is average value | Max value | Min value | How to load data | Delete data | Sort Data. | . Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data. . Basics of Pandas. . import pandas as pd # What this does is it calls the python pandas library and this code segment is needed whenever incorporating pandas. . DICTIONARIES AND DATASETS . One way you are able to manipulate a pandas data set is by creating a dictionary and calling it as seen with the dict data 1 and pd.dataframe which is a way to print the set. | . import pandas as pd data1 = { &#39;teams&#39;: [&quot;BARCA&quot;, &quot;REAL&quot;, &quot;ATLETICO&quot;], &#39;standings&#39;: [1, 2, 3] } myvar = pd.DataFrame(data1) print(myvar) . teams standings 0 BARCA 1 1 REAL 2 2 ATLETICO 3 . Indexing and manipulaton of data through lists. . With pandas you can also organize the data which is one of its biggest perks, we call this indexing, this is when we define the first column in a data frame. | . import pandas as pd score = [5/5, 5/5, 1/5] myvar = pd.Series(score, index = [&quot;math&quot;, &quot;science&quot;, &quot;pe&quot;]) print(myvar) . math 1.0 science 1.0 pe 0.2 dtype: float64 . Pandas Classes . Within pandas the library consits of a lot of functions which allow you to manipulate datasets in lists dictionsaries and csv files here are some of the ones we are going to cover (hint: take notes on these) . Series: The sequence of values that follow a specific pattern. | Index: A data structure that can retrieve data by a key. | PeriodIndex: Index that used in time-series data analysis, for example a time range. | DataframeGroupedBy: A method used in data analysis libraries. | Categorical: Data that is divided into categories. | Time Stamp: A data that record the time of a action or event. | . PeriodIndex . This allows for a way to repeat data over time that it occurs as seen from january 2022 to december 2023. You can use Y for years, M for months, and D for days. | . import pandas as pd time = pd.period_range(&#39;2022-01&#39;, &#39;2022-12&#39;, freq=&#39;M&#39;) print(time) . PeriodIndex([&#39;2022-01&#39;, &#39;2022-02&#39;, &#39;2022-03&#39;, &#39;2022-04&#39;, &#39;2022-05&#39;, &#39;2022-06&#39;, &#39;2022-07&#39;, &#39;2022-08&#39;, &#39;2022-09&#39;, &#39;2022-10&#39;, &#39;2022-11&#39;, &#39;2022-12&#39;], dtype=&#39;period[M]&#39;) . Now implement a way to show a period index from June 2022 to July 2023 in days. . import pandas as pd time = pd.period_range(&#39;2022-06&#39;,&#39;2023-07&#39;, freq=&#39;D&#39;) print(time) .

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a Dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # The out put eliminate the duplicate numbers # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Be # . {1, 2, 3} .

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

There are no exclusion since who have a electronic device can access the app. It is somehow harmful for kids since some videos have bad effects and children tends to became addicted to tictok by the way video slide and the content of the videos. It should be not corrected since the businesses are making a lots of money with it. . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . Female voice can usually being trusted by human and humans have preference in voice. It is not harmful since very less people became addicted to virtual assistants. It should be not corrected and it is good for business since people relies on these tools. . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? . Yes, he think this is intentional because he think it&#39;s racist. . How do you think this happened? . The company didn&#39;t run enough test to test this function. . Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? . Yes, because black people will not be able to use this function in some necessary situation. It is mainly exclude than harmful. . Should it be corrected? . Yes, this should be corrected. . What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? . Add more samples to give black people access to use this function. . We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API&#8217;s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data.

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter).

Collatz in 1937, also called the 3x+1 mapping, 3n+1 problem, Hasse&#39;s algorithm, Kakutani&#39;s problem, Syracuse algorithm, Syracuse problem, Thwaites conjecture, and Ulam&#39;s problem (Lagarias 1985). Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1000 reward for resolving the conjecture. Let a_0 be an integer. Then one form of Collatz problem asks if iterating . always returns to 1 for positive a_0. (If negative numbers are included, there are four known cycles (excluding the trivial 0 cycle): (4, 2, 1), (-2, -1), (-5, -14, -7, -20, -10), and (-17, -50, -25, -74, -37, -110, -55, -164, -82, -41, -122, -61, -182, -91, -272, -136, -68, -34).) . The members of the sequence produced by the Collatz are sometimes known as hailstone numbers. Conway proved that the original Collatz problem has no nontrivial cycles of length &lt;400. Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length &lt;275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem. . The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all numbers &lt;=19·2^(58) approx 5.48×10^(18) (Oliveira e Silva 2008), improving the earlier results of 10^(15) (Vardi 1991, p. 129) and 5.6×10^(13) (Leavens and Vermeulen 1992). Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that &quot;mathematics is not yet ready for such problems&quot; (Lagarias 1985). . The numbers of steps required for the algorithm to reach 1 for a_0=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, ... (OEIS A006577; illustrated above). Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666). The smallest starting values of a_0 that yields a Collatz sequence containing n=1, 2, ... are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 12, 7, 9, 15, 3, 7, 18, 19, ... (OEIS A070167). . The Collatz problem can be implemented as an 8-register machine (Wolfram 2002, p. 100), quasi-cellular automaton (Cloney et al. 1987, Bruschi 2005), or 6-color one-dimensional quasi-cellular automaton with local rules but which wraps first and last digits around (Zeleny). In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA&#39;s speed of light). . More information . Hacks/Assignment . Take the two codes above and combine them so one imput gives the output that contains both the hailstone numbers and the number of iterations it takes i = 1. The more efficient the code, the higher your grade will be. (Algorithm Efficency) (.25) . Unit 3, Section 17: Algorithm Efficiency - Kush &amp; Yasha . What is Algorithm Efficiency? . Yasha - Algorithmic efficiency is an aspect of algorithmic programming that measures the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other. . Here is an example of an inefficient algorithm: . def inefficientWay(numbers): # Then it loops over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # Now it finds the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # Then it swaps the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(inefficientWay([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - This algorithm is inefficent because it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. This is an inefficient way to sort a list. . Kush - Here is an efficent way to sort a list: . def efficient_sort(numbers): # loop over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # swap the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(efficient_sort([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - The difference in this algorithm is that it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. . How can you use algorithms to better your life: Mini activity . Yasha - Just for a second, think about all the tasks in your life that would work so much better automated. The sky&#39;s the limit. For an activity, write down or take a mental note of a task that you encounter in your day to day life, and think of ways where you can automate that task. An example of this would be me creating an algorithm for my morning routine. . tasks = [&quot;wake up&quot;, &quot;eat breakfast&quot;, &quot;brush teeth&quot;, &quot;go to school&quot;] def complete_tasks(tasks): for task in tasks: # code to complete each task goes here if task == &quot;wake up&quot;: print(&quot;Waking up now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;eat breakfast&quot;: print(&quot;Eating breakfast now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;go to school&quot;: print(&quot;Going to school now!&quot;) # and so on for each task in the list # call the function to complete the tasks complete_tasks(tasks) . Waking up now! Eating breakfast now! Going to school now! . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P1 . Kush - Sometimes when a problem has too many possibilities, a heuristic approach would be taken. let&#39;s use planes as an example. Imagine you were a musician on tour. You have shows in New Zealand, United States, Canada, and Russia. Well, what would be the shortest flight route so you can arrive at those destinations as fast as possible? You start in the United States. . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P2 . Kush - Well, since there are multiple possibilities, I chose to pick the countries closest to each other. The reason I chose this algorithm in particular is that it made the most sense. I had to start at United States, but then I went on to Canada, Russia, New Zealand, and then back to the United States. . Visual Representation . Hacks/assignment .

Experiment . We did a four corner experiment in class. We create for corner in the classroom where student could stand and let the teacher randomly pick one corner which will will be terminated. This is the same principle as the random library in python. .",

College Board Essential Knowledge . A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs. | Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code. | The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work. | . Defining a Library . A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program. | Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process. | Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called &quot; .&quot; This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code. | . Example . import math math.sqrt(64) . 8.0 . Review Questions (Answer for candy!) . . 1) In your own words, what is a library? . 2) Why are libraries useful when writing a program? . 3) What keyword is used to add a pre-made library? . Hacks . Write a program that uses a library/libraries in any sort of manner. | Explain your work/code | . . . Lesson 3.15.1 . What is randomization? . 1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 8 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 14 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 15 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 9 7 4 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. .

What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. . What is wrong with the function? . Can you translate the binary numbers into decimal notation? . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: None Cube: None . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool? &quot; a_count = count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s) d_count = count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s) print(&quot;Words starting with a:&quot;, a_count) print(&quot;Words starting with d:&quot;, d_count) . Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguments that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; .

Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow!

Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) .

Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language | Define an iteration | The Basics Of Iteration | Examples | LESSON Vocab: . Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . .

Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(10): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

Unit 3 Section 8.1 - Taiyo Iwazaki . Lesson Objectives: . Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language | Define an iteration | The Basics Of Iteration | Examples | LESSON Vocab: . Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . . Lets say you are looking for a lost item inside of your house... What steps would you take? . Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(10): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

Explain in your own words what each logical operator does | Code your own scenario that makes sense for each logical operator | . Conditionals . Paaras Purohit and Shruthi Damodar . title: Conditionals | toc: true | categories: [tri2lesson] | permalink: /conditionals | tags: [tri2lesson] | . Learning Objectives / Some Things You Might Want to Keep Note Of . Conditionals allow for the expression of algorithms that utilize selection without a programming language. | Writing conditional statements is key to computer science. | Determine the result of conditional statements | . Key Terms . Selection: The specific block of code that will execute depending on the algorithm condition returning true or false. | Algorithm: &quot;A finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.&quot; | Conditional Statement / If-Statement: A statement that affects the sequence of control by executing certain statements depending on the value of a boolean. | . Conditional Statements in JavaScript . Below is an example of an algorithm in JavaScript that uses selection: . function isEven(parameter) { if (parameter % 2 == 0) { console.log(&quot;The number is even.&quot;); } else if (parameter % 2 != 0) { console.log(&quot;The number is odd.&quot;) } } isEven(4) . Cell In[23], line 1 function isEven(parameter) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . A computer science student such as yourself will see conditional statements in JavaScript a lot. Below is an example of one in action: . if (30 == 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is true&quot;) } . Cell In[5], line 1 if (30 == 7) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . That is one conditional statement, but this algorithm is too simple to have anything done with it. Below is an algorithm building on the previous algorithm: . if (30 == 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is true&quot;) } else if (30 != 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is false&quot;) } . Cell In[21], line 1 if (30 == 7) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Conditional statements can be used for many a purpose. The algorithm above was quite simple, but conditionals can be found in more complex algorithms. . Binary Numbers . Let&#39;s do some truth tables! . Speed round . Challenges . Challenges Related to the Lesson That I Solved Myself . Note: I did these in Python . Level I: Vowel Count . Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string. We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this challenge (but not y). The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces. . Hint: If you use a lot of if-statements and there are more than one outcome, that is to be expected. If not, don&#39;t panic, just keep trying. . Level II: Who Likes It? . You probably know the &quot;like&quot; system from Facebook and other pages. People can &quot;like&quot; blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item. . Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples: . [] --&gt; &quot;no one likes this&quot; . [&quot;Peter&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Peter likes this&quot; . [&quot;Jacob&quot;, &quot;Alex&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Jacob and Alex like this&quot; . [&quot;Max&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Max, John and Mark like this&quot; . [&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Jacob&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Max&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this&quot; . Note: For 4 or more names, the number in &quot;and 2 others&quot; simply increases. . Hint: This requires you to combine knowledge on lists along with the conditionals you learned in this lesson. . Level III: Mutliples of 3 or 5 . If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. . Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them). . Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. . Hint: What do you know about for loops? Since your code incorporates a list of numbers from 1 to the max number, can you use for loops along with conditionals? . Level IV: Likes vs. Dislikes . YouTube had a like and a dislike button, which allowed users to express their opinions about particular content. It was set up in such a way that you cannot like and dislike a video at the same time. There are two other interesting rules to be noted about the interface: Pressing a button, which is already active, will undo your press. If you press the like button after pressing the dislike button, the like button overwrites the previous &quot;Dislike&quot; state. The same is true for the other way round. . Create a function that takes in a list of button inputs and returns the final state. . Examples: . /* like_or_dislike([Dislike]) ➞ Dislike like_or_dislike([Like, Like]) ➞ Nothing like_or_dislike([Dislike, Like]) ➞ Like like_or_dislike([Like, Dislike, Dislike]) ➞ Nothing */ . Notes . If no button is currently active, return Nothing. | If the list is empty, return Nothing. | . Hint: This is like level III, but harder, so don&#39;t give up! . Level V: Find the Odd Number . Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times. . There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times. . Examples: . [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd). . [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd). . [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd). . [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd). . [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd). . Hint: This is by far the hardest challenge out of all of these, in my opinion, and it took me about 3 or 4 months to solve this one. .

Lesson 3.7 James . Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements | they&#39;re nested one inside the other | An else if inside of another else if | Can be used for a varying amount of &quot;else if statements.&quot; The first if statement can represent if two coditions are true. The first else if can represent if only one or the other is true. The last else if represents if neither of the conditions are true. | Can have three different conditions | . Take aways . Learn how to determine the result of nested condtional statements | Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements | One condition leads to check in a second condition | . Writing Nested Conditional Statements . Can be planned and writen out first | Flow chart is a possibility. Ask a question. If the statement is false end the flowchart with one result.

            "content": "Topic 3.12 (3.A) Calling &amp; Understanding Procedures - Kaiden &amp; Amay . Overview: Learning Objectives . Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 . Quiz (Part of Hacks) . Complete this quiz: . questionNum = 3 correct = 0 questions = [ &quot;What is are correct names for a procedure? n A) Method n B) Function n C) Both&quot;, &quot;What is a procedure? n A) Sequencing n B) Selection n C) Iteration n D) All&quot;, &quot;Use this for following question: n def inchesToFeet(lengthInches): n t lengthFeet = lengthInches / 12 n t return lengthFeet n n What is the procedure name, the parameter, and what the procedure returns? n A) feetToInches, lengthInches, lengthMeters n B) inchesToFeet, lengthInches, lengthFeet n C) inchesToFeet, lengthFeet, lengthInches n D) lengthInches, inchesToFeet, lengthFeet&quot;] answers = [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] def qna(question, answer): print(&quot;Question:&quot;, question) response = input() print(&quot;Answer:&quot;, response) if response.lower() == answer: print(&quot;Correct :) n&quot;) global correct correct += 1 else: print(&quot;Incorrect :( n&quot;) for x in range(questionNum): qna(questions[x], answers[x]) print(&quot;Score:&quot;, correct, &quot;/ 3&quot;) . Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . Ex: . def divide(num1,num2): x = num1/num2 return x . what is x being assigned to inside the function? . | As a reminder, to use function parameters, you would have to write the syntax name of the function followed by the parameters needed in parentheses . | Function parameters are the parameters that are used when calling the function in order to get a result. . | . What are the function parameters in this procedure? . What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. . What is wrong with the function? . Can you translate the binary numbers into decimal notation? . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: None Cube: None . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string!

Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguments that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; .

            "content": "Unit 3.9 . 3.9.1 Algorithms (Claire) . A little review on Algorithms: . what are the three components of an algorithm? . sel__ | seq__ | it___ | . Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;You failed&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? You failed . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . Why is this important? . When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . How to write Nested Conditionals as Boolean expressions . the following 2 pieces of code is supposed to print &quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot; unless: . it is a weekday | . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True #if holiday, dont go to school if isHoliday == True: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) # otherwise, if it is a weekday, go to school else: if isWeekday == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # but if it is neither a weekday or holiday, don&#39;t go to school else: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot;) . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True # setting variables here (same as above to make comparison easier) driveSchool = not(isHoliday) and isWeekday if driveSchool == False: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) if driveSchool == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # now we can make a regular conditional/ if statement without having a nested conditional . Hacks . why is it important to know that algorithms that look different can do the same thing and that algorithms that look the same might have different results?(0.15) | for the converted conditional to boolean conversion(0.10) | total: 0.25 | . 3.9.2 Developing Algorithms (Annika) . Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 . Start | The number of pretzels in the pack is 6 | Eat one pretzels, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1 | How many pretzels are left? | Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0 | Display that pack is empty | Finish | pretzel = 6 while (pretzel &gt; 0): pretzel -= 1 print(pretzel) if pretzel == 0: print(&quot;All done!&quot;) . Example 2 . The parking rate for a garage is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 &lt;br&gt; 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 &lt;br&gt; 4+ hours: $12 . . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . Hacks . Develop your own complex algorithm using a flowchart and natural language, then code it! . Requirements: . Includes both a flowchart AND natural language | Working code of the same algorithm | Incorporates selection AND/OR iteration | Make it creative! | . Tips: . This site is good for making flowcharts! | Natural language should just be a list | Think about the whole process, not just the end result | . 3.9.3 Using preexisting algorithms (Grace) . Main Idea . Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors | . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from following the Collatz Conjecture. . Example: 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . What does this function do? . if (n MOD 2 = 0) { display(&quot;n is even&quot;) } else { display(&quot;n is odd&quot;) } . By modifying the preexisting code, we can write create new code that follows th Collatz Conjecture. . DISPLAY (&quot;Choose a value for n&quot;) n &lt;- INPUT () REPEAT UNTIL (n = 1) { IF (n MOD 2 = 0 ) { n &lt;- n/2 } ELSE { n &lt;- n * 3 + 1 } . Hacks . Fix the number guessing game . Make a flow chart for the algorithm number guessing game | Make a function that gets the user guess | Modify the existing search function to give more encouraging feedback | import random #sets variables for the game num_guesses = 0 user_guess = 0 upper_bound = 100 lower_bound = 0 #generates a random number number = random.randint(1,100) # print(number) #for testing purposes print(f&quot;I&#39;m thinking of a number between 1 and 100.&quot;) #Write a function that gets a guess from the user using input() def guess(): #add something here return #add something here #Change the print statements to give feedback on whether the player guessed too high or too low def search(number, guess): global lower_bound, upper_bound if guess &lt; number: print(&quot;You are bad at guessing&quot;) #change this lower_bound = guess elif guess &gt; number: print(&quot;You suck :(&quot;) #change this upper_bound = guess return lower_bound, upper_bound while user_guess != number: user_guess = guess() num_guesses += 1 print(f&quot;You guessed {user_guess}.&quot;) lower_bound, upper_bound = search(number, user_guess) print(f&quot;Guess a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.&quot;) print(f&quot;You guessed the number in {num_guesses} guesses!&quot;) . Unit 3.11 Binary Search (Claire) . Binary Search: . repeatedly dividing a search interval in half . Binary Search Steps: . first put the numbers in order ascending | descending | . | find the middle number first this is found by taking the highest index number plus the lowest index number and divide by 2 | the numbers on the right will be greater and the numbers on the left will be smaller | this can be represented with a binary tree middle number with the smaller number branched off on the left and bigger numbers branched off on the right | . | . | these lists are not always numbers lists can be made with strings | ex. [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;, &quot;peach&quot;, &quot;watermelon&quot;] | alphabetical order a-z | z-a | . | . | . Practice: . What is the middle number in a Binary Search given the following set of numbers in order: 1, 5, 19, 44, 89 | What is the middle number in a Binary Search given the following set of numbers that are not in order: 3, 87, 12, 66, 22 | Hacks: . calculate the middle index and create a binary tree for each of these lists 12, 14, 43, 57, 79, 80, 99 | 92, 43, 74, 66, 30, 12, 1 | 7, 13, 96, 111, 33, 84, 60 | . | Using one of the sets of numbers from the question above, what would be the second number looked at in a binary search if the number is more than the middle number? | Which of the following lists can NOT a binary search be used in order to find a targeted value? . a.

            "content": "Unit 3, Section 1.1: Data Types and Variables - Ederick . Essential Knowledge (College Board&#39;s Must Knows): . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than antoher. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as &quot;containers&quot; and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of &quot;Alex.&quot; How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . x = &quot;alex&quot; print(x) . alex . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named &quot;age&quot; becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . Example: . age = &quot;Timmy&quot; name = &quot;25&quot; print(name + &quot; is &quot; + age) . 25 is Timmy . Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion | . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone&#39;s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): . How can we update a variable&#39;s value | What function is used to recieve a user&#39;s input? | Variables (3.1.2) - Noor . Learning objective for 3.1.2: . Determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment . done through looking at how we can use the assignment operator | . Note: . Collegeboard uses &lt;-- as the assignment operator . The assignment operator looks different for different types of coding languages A variable will take the most recent value assigned | . How do you even store a value inside a variable? . Let&#39;s use python for our example: . In python, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=) | In order to store a value inside a variable, we must: Give the variable a name | place the assignment operator | input the variable value | . | . highscore = 100 # How do you store a number like 3.72? money = 3.72 # What about storing your username (string)? username = &quot;name&quot; # What if it is raining outside and you want to store that fact (boolean)? is_raining = True # What about a list of groceries? groceries = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;flour&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;] . Lets Look at an Example: . x = 10 y = 20 z = 30 x = y z = x # what do you think z will be? print(z) . 20 . Let&#39;s get a little more practical here . Imagine that you are making a calendar and have just finished the html code that is needed: . You now want to be able to switch between the months of the year by using the &quot;next&quot; or &quot;prev&quot; buttons you will need to take the html elements and use them to your advantage but how? | . | . | . &lt;body&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;calendar&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;month&quot;&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;prev&quot;&gt;Prev&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; // to make our lives a little easier, we can store the div next and prev into variables // this way we don&#39;t need to type out as much // Note: You CAN just add the event listener to document.querySelector(.next) or prev and get the same desired outcome nextButton = document.querySelector(.next) prevButton = document.querySelector(.prev) // we can go make the buttons functional by adding an addeventlistner to them &lt;/script&gt; . Recap: . We learned what is a assignment operator | We learned how to use the assignment operator | We learned how to store a value inside a variable using the assignment operator | We experimented with a few examples | . Hacks: . Answer these: . In your own words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is | Assignment operator assign values to variables. | In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables? | Arrows like &quot;num1 → 3&quot; | A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22? | 22 | . Hacks: . Copy the all the html code into a markdown file and run your local server. You will then see a decimal to binary converter near the html code. The problem is that it is not converting the decimal to binary. This is because the variables are not defined properly and it is your job to use the information learned today to fix the converter. Don&#39;t change the css . Bonus (optional): . There&#39;s more than one way to define the variable. List two ways to do it. . Rubric . For .15: . Student has followed directions properly and has the converter working | . For .18: . Student has completed some of the bonus material alongside requirement for 2.7 | . For .20: . Student has completed all of the material, answered thoughtfully, and met requirements for 2.7 | . List and Strings Using Variables- Nathan . Strings . Strings is a series of characters (numbers, letters, etc), one example of a string is your name or your id because strings can contain both numbers and letters. . The following are all examples of strings being used in code, in this case, within print functions. . print(&quot;hello world&quot;) print(&#39;hello&#39;) . hello world hello . Lists . Lists are sequences of elements with each element being a variable. An example of a list can be the names of the students in this classroom. . Features of Lists . The elements within the list can be accessed by index. | Can store various elements | The list is in order | . Example of a list . thanksgivingList = [&quot;cranberry pie&quot;, &quot;casserole&quot;, &quot;mashed potatoes&quot;, &quot;turkey&quot;] print(thanksgivingList) . [&#39;cranberry pie&#39;, &#39;casserole&#39;, &#39;mashed potatoes&#39;, &#39;turkey&#39;] . List Index . An index is an element of a string. Indices typically start with 0, but Collegeboard has the index start at 1. . print(thanksgivingList[1]) #In this case, the index starts at 0, but in collegeboard, the index starts at 1 print(thanksgivingList[-3]) #Python can index from the end, in this case, &quot;turkey&quot; would be index -1 and 3. . casserole casserole . Hacks . Questions . What is a list? | What is an element | What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string? | What is an example of a string? | . Hacks . Create a list with indices | Index a part of the list that you created. | Try to index from the end | . Create an index of your favorite foods . Tips: Index starts at 1, Strings are ordered sequences of characters . Extra work: Try to create an index that lists your favorite food and print the element at index 3. More work: Create a list of your favorite foods and create an index to access them. . marks = [&quot;food1&quot;] . Rubric . Creating a list . Shows great knowledge in creating lists | . Indexing . Is able to index both from the start and from the end | . Data Abstraction with Lists - Steven . Data abstraction can be created with lists. . Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths. | The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. | The user does not need to know how the list stores data (this gives way for data abstraction). | . In the code below, the logic itself works with a list, but the code abstracts it into a sequence of bits in a string (as seen in the input and output). To make this work, the splitbits lists is created and processed. At the end of the code, the result is outputted as a string rather than a list (abstraction). . bits = input(&quot;Input a sequence of bits to invert: &quot;) splitbits = list(bits) for i in range(len(splitbits)): if splitbits[i] == &#39;0&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;1&#39; elif splitbits[i] == &#39;1&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;0&#39; print(&quot;&quot;.join(splitbits)) . Hacks . The following code is incomplete. Its intended purpose is to increase three numbers, all of which ask for user input, by an amount specified the user. The input code is abstracted, but the actual logic isn&#39;t connected to the abstraction. | . num1=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) num2=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) num3=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) add=input(&quot;How much would you like to add? &quot;) # Add code in the space below # The following is the code that adds the inputted addend to the other numbers. It is hidden from the user. for i in numlist: numlist[i -1] += int(add) print(numlist) . The following provides a rubric for my hacks (scored out of 0.20) . 0.20 - Fully functioning data abstraction with a list | 0.10 - not functioning, but attempt at making a list | 0.00 - not functioning, no evidence of attempt based upon the guidelines | . Managing Complexity with lists - Liav . Long and slow way . By now, everyone should know the &quot;long and slow way&quot; to print a list of something in python It is easy to just assign a value to a single variable | This method is displayed in this example with test scores: | . | . score1 = 95 score2 = 24 score3 = 87 score4 = 92 print(score1, score2, score3, score4) . As you can see, each score is assigned to its relative variable such as &quot;score1 = 95&quot; and then you just print each variable. | However you can make the code segment faster, easier to read, and more efficient... | . Assinging values to one variable . Use square brackets &quot;[]&quot; to store the values of a certain variable, then you can simply print the variable to output your desired list: | . scores = [95, 24, 87, 92] print(scores) . Now instead of having a difference variable and new line of code for each value, the list is simply displayed by assigning each value to a single value that you can now print. | . How lists manage complexity of a program . Simplification . It is much simpler, faster, and easier to code lists this way | Makes the code segment much easier to read | . | Variables . You do not need as many variables, because you can just assign all corresponding values to a single variable | To change a value you don&#39;t have to edit/add/remove an entire variable | . | . Python Quiz . Now everyone should take this short python quiz and screenshot your score. | . import getpass, sys def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 4 correct = 0 print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) question_with_response(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;The purpose of lists and dictionaries are to manage the ____ of a program&quot;) if rsp == &quot;complexity&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Lists are a form of data ______&quot;) if rsp == &quot;abstraction&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Which brackets are used to assign values to a variable to make a list?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;[]&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) .

An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) .

It&#39;s a great first language for web developers to learn. . W3Schools - reference | feecodecamp.org - pbl . | javascript30.com - pbl . | . console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher); // before role logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // ok to do this even though role is not yet defined // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // set the role logItType(teacher); logItType(teacher.toJSON()); . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;&#34;} object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure.

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop().

Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.
