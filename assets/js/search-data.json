The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a Dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # The out put eliminate the duplicate numbers # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Be # . {1, 2, 3} .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy.

The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. . Hailstone numbers . The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers. Examples:Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.&gt; ### Iteration The action or a process of iterating or repeating:such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result. . Undecidable problems . An undecidable problem is one that should give a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. . Unsolvable problems . An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. . Additional information . A problem posed by L. Collatz in 1937, also called the 3x+1 mapping, 3n+1 problem, Hasse&#39;s algorithm, Kakutani&#39;s problem, Syracuse algorithm, Syracuse problem, Thwaites conjecture, and Ulam&#39;s problem (Lagarias 1985). Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1000 reward for resolving the conjecture. Let a_0 be an integer. Then one form of Collatz problem asks if iterating . always returns to 1 for positive a_0. (If negative numbers are included, there are four known cycles (excluding the trivial 0 cycle): (4, 2, 1), (-2, -1), (-5, -14, -7, -20, -10), and (-17, -50, -25, -74, -37, -110, -55, -164, -82, -41, -122, -61, -182, -91, -272, -136, -68, -34).) . The members of the sequence produced by the Collatz are sometimes known as hailstone numbers. Conway proved that the original Collatz problem has no nontrivial cycles of length &lt;400. Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length &lt;275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem. . The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all numbers &lt;=19·2^(58) approx 5.48×10^(18) (Oliveira e Silva 2008), improving the earlier results of 10^(15) (Vardi 1991, p. 129) and 5.6×10^(13) (Leavens and Vermeulen 1992). Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that &quot;mathematics is not yet ready for such problems&quot; (Lagarias 1985). . The numbers of steps required for the algorithm to reach 1 for a_0=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, ... (OEIS A006577; illustrated above). Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666). The smallest starting values of a_0 that yields a Collatz sequence containing n=1, 2, ... are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 12, 7, 9, 15, 3, 7, 18, 19, ... (OEIS A070167). . The Collatz problem can be implemented as an 8-register machine (Wolfram 2002, p. 100), quasi-cellular automaton (Cloney et al. 1987, Bruschi 2005), or 6-color one-dimensional quasi-cellular automaton with local rules but which wraps first and last digits around (Zeleny). In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA&#39;s speed of light). . More information . Hacks/Assignment . Take the two codes above and combine them so one imput gives the output that contains both the hailstone numbers and the number of iterations it takes i = 1. The more efficient the code, the higher your grade will be. (Algorithm Efficency) (.25) . Unit 3, Section 17: Algorithm Efficiency - Kush &amp; Yasha . What is Algorithm Efficiency? . Yasha - Algorithmic efficiency is an aspect of algorithmic programming that measures the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other. . Here is an example of an inefficient algorithm: . def inefficientWay(numbers): # Then it loops over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # Now it finds the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # Then it swaps the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(inefficientWay([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - This algorithm is inefficent because it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. This is an inefficient way to sort a list. . Kush - Here is an efficent way to sort a list: . def efficient_sort(numbers): # loop over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # swap the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(efficient_sort([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - The difference in this algorithm is that it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. . How can you use algorithms to better your life: Mini activity . Yasha - Just for a second, think about all the tasks in your life that would work so much better automated. The sky&#39;s the limit. For an activity, write down or take a mental note of a task that you encounter in your day to day life, and think of ways where you can automate that task. An example of this would be me creating an algorithm for my morning routine. . tasks = [&quot;wake up&quot;, &quot;eat breakfast&quot;, &quot;brush teeth&quot;, &quot;go to school&quot;] def complete_tasks(tasks): for task in tasks: # code to complete each task goes here if task == &quot;wake up&quot;: print(&quot;Waking up now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;eat breakfast&quot;: print(&quot;Eating breakfast now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;go to school&quot;: print(&quot;Going to school now!&quot;) # and so on for each task in the list # call the function to complete the tasks complete_tasks(tasks) . Waking up now! Eating breakfast now! Going to school now! . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P1 . Kush - Sometimes when a problem has too many possibilities, a heuristic approach would be taken. let&#39;s use planes as an example. Imagine you were a musician on tour. You have shows in New Zealand, United States, Canada, and Russia. Well, what would be the shortest flight route so you can arrive at those destinations as fast as possible? You start in the United States. . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P2 . Kush - Well, since there are multiple possibilities, I chose to pick the countries closest to each other. The reason I chose this algorithm in particular is that it made the most sense. I had to start at United States, but then I went on to Canada, Russia, New Zealand, and then back to the United States. . Visual Representation . Hacks/assignment .

Below is a simulation of the Game of Life, originally written by John Horton Conway. Mr. Mortensen has this game on the APCSP site and we think that it is a great example of an interactive simulation. . What it is . This game is an unpredictable cellular automaton | automaton = simulates and imitates human life, hence why this is called the game of life | After creating the initial configuration, the game evolves without pattern | . How it works . Cells in this game are alive or dead, similar to binary where they are on or off | The user created an initial configuration of cells on the grid, and presses play (tap the squares on the grid) | a cells&#39;s status (alive or dead, on or off) depends on the surrounding 8 cells status (surrounding 8 boxes). Here are the rules: The birth rule= a dead cell (blue box) that is surrounded by at least 3 alive cells (yellow boxes), will become alive | The death rule= an alive cell (yellow) with no or only one surviving cell around it dies (becomes blue) | Cell survival= an alive cell (yellow) with 2 or 3 alive neighboring cells will stay alive | . | . Try it Out! . Use the grid below to create cell figurations, press play, and watch your cells die, live, and move around! . . Remix of Game of Life . start step . . Hack #3 .

College Board Essential Knowledge . A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs. | Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code. | The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work. | . Defining a Library . A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program. | Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process. | Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called &quot; .&quot; This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code. | . Example . import math math.sqrt(64) . 8.0 . Review Questions (Answer for candy!) . . 1) In your own words, what is a library? . 2) Why are libraries useful when writing a program? . 3) What keyword is used to add a pre-made library? . Hacks . Write a program that uses a library/libraries in any sort of manner. | Explain your work/code | . . . Lesson 3.15.1 . What is randomization? . 1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 8 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 14 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 15 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 9 7 4 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. . Method | Description . seed() | Initialize the random number generator . getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator . setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator . getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits . randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range . randint() | Returns a random number between the given range . choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence . choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence . shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order . sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence . random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 . uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters . betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) . expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) . gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) . gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) . lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) . normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) . vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) . paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) . weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) . Lesson Recap: 1) random function generates a random number from a to b (range of two numbers) . 2) You need to import random in order to use the random function . 3) Every result from an import function is equally likely to occur .

Some Essential Knowledge that you need to know | RANDOM (a,b) will provide you with a random integer between the numbers a-b | Ex. RANDOM (7,18) can provide you with the number 13. | Using a random generator means each result can come out as different. | . Lets Try an Example Scenario . Try and formulate a way to write a segment of code that can simulate the flipping of a coin. | You have to use a random generator and assign the output of &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot; to a specified result. | . import random flip = random.randint(1,2) if flip == 1: print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: print(&quot;Tails&quot;) # Try this code for yourself! . Heads . This is a pretty simple code to understand. | First we use the randomization here between the 1 and 2 to determine which side of the coin we get. | If we get 1 then we get heads. If we get 2 or anything else than 2, then we get Tails. | . Now let&#39;s answer questions using your knowledge. . If you want yes to show up 50% of the time, which of the code segments can you use? | . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 random(1,100) == 50 random(1,10) &lt;= 5 random(1,10) &gt;= 5 . The answer is A,C, and D! | . Why isn&#39;t the answer B? . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | .

Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 . Quiz (Part of Hacks) .

Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . Ex: . def divide(num1,num2): x = num1/num2 return x . what is x being assigned to inside the function? . | As a reminder, to use function parameters, you would have to write the syntax name of the function followed by the parameters needed in parentheses . | Function parameters are the parameters that are used when calling the function in order to get a result. . | . What are the function parameters in this procedure? . What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. . What is wrong with the function? . Can you translate the binary numbers into decimal notation? . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: None Cube: None . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool? &quot; a_count = count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s) d_count = count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s) print(&quot;Words starting with a:&quot;, a_count) print(&quot;Words starting with d:&quot;, d_count) . Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguments that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; .

            "content": "Unit 3.9 . 3.9.1 Algorithms (Claire) . A little review on Algorithms: . what are the three components of an algorithm? . sel__ | seq__ | it___ | . Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;You failed&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? You failed . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . Why is this important? . When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . How to write Nested Conditionals as Boolean expressions . the following 2 pieces of code is supposed to print &quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot; unless: . it is a weekday | . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True #if holiday, dont go to school if isHoliday == True: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) # otherwise, if it is a weekday, go to school else: if isWeekday == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # but if it is neither a weekday or holiday, don&#39;t go to school else: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot;) . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True # setting variables here (same as above to make comparison easier) driveSchool = not(isHoliday) and isWeekday if driveSchool == False: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) if driveSchool == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # now we can make a regular conditional/ if statement without having a nested conditional . Hacks . why is it important to know that algorithms that look different can do the same thing and that algorithms that look the same might have different results?(0.15) | for the converted conditional to boolean conversion(0.10) | total: 0.25 | . 3.9.2 Developing Algorithms (Annika) . Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 . Start | The number of pretzels in the pack is 6 | Eat one pretzels, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1 | How many pretzels are left? | Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0 | Display that pack is empty | Finish | pretzel = 6 while (pretzel &gt; 0): pretzel -= 1 print(pretzel) if pretzel == 0: print(&quot;All done!&quot;) . Example 2 . The parking rate for a garage is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 &lt;br&gt; 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 &lt;br&gt; 4+ hours: $12 . . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . Hacks . Develop your own complex algorithm using a flowchart and natural language, then code it! . Requirements: . Includes both a flowchart AND natural language | Working code of the same algorithm | Incorporates selection AND/OR iteration | Make it creative! | . Tips: . This site is good for making flowcharts! | Natural language should just be a list | Think about the whole process, not just the end result | . 3.9.3 Using preexisting algorithms (Grace) . Main Idea . Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors | . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from following the Collatz Conjecture. . Example: 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . What does this function do? . if (n MOD 2 = 0) { display(&quot;n is even&quot;) } else { display(&quot;n is odd&quot;) } . By modifying the preexisting code, we can write create new code that follows th Collatz Conjecture. . DISPLAY (&quot;Choose a value for n&quot;) n &lt;- INPUT () REPEAT UNTIL (n = 1) { IF (n MOD 2 = 0 ) { n &lt;- n/2 } ELSE { n &lt;- n * 3 + 1 } . Hacks . Fix the number guessing game . Make a flow chart for the algorithm number guessing game | Make a function that gets the user guess | Modify the existing search function to give more encouraging feedback | import random #sets variables for the game num_guesses = 0 user_guess = 0 upper_bound = 100 lower_bound = 0 #generates a random number number = random.randint(1,100) # print(number) #for testing purposes print(f&quot;I&#39;m thinking of a number between 1 and 100.&quot;) #Write a function that gets a guess from the user using input() def guess(): #add something here return #add something here #Change the print statements to give feedback on whether the player guessed too high or too low def search(number, guess): global lower_bound, upper_bound if guess &lt; number: print(&quot;You are bad at guessing&quot;) #change this lower_bound = guess elif guess &gt; number: print(&quot;You suck :(&quot;) #change this upper_bound = guess return lower_bound, upper_bound while user_guess != number: user_guess = guess() num_guesses += 1 print(f&quot;You guessed {user_guess}.&quot;) lower_bound, upper_bound = search(number, user_guess) print(f&quot;Guess a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.&quot;) print(f&quot;You guessed the number in {num_guesses} guesses!&quot;) . Unit 3.11 Binary Search (Claire) . Binary Search: . repeatedly dividing a search interval in half . Binary Search Steps: . first put the numbers in order ascending | descending | . | find the middle number first this is found by taking the highest index number plus the lowest index number and divide by 2 | the numbers on the right will be greater and the numbers on the left will be smaller | this can be represented with a binary tree middle number with the smaller number branched off on the left and bigger numbers branched off on the right | . | . | these lists are not always numbers lists can be made with strings | ex.

Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . .

Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(10): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

(Hint think of how domain/range of graph is answered) | How is binary related to this? | How could this be used when asked a question? | . Examples (Not part of homework) .

Explain in your own words what each logical operator does | Code your own scenario that makes sense for each logical operator | . Conditionals . Paaras Purohit and Shruthi Damodar . title: Conditionals | toc: true | categories: [tri2lesson] | permalink: /conditionals | tags: [tri2lesson] | . Learning Objectives / Some Things You Might Want to Keep Note Of . Conditionals allow for the expression of algorithms that utilize selection without a programming language. | Writing conditional statements is key to computer science. | Determine the result of conditional statements | . Key Terms . Selection: The specific block of code that will execute depending on the algorithm condition returning true or false. | Algorithm: &quot;A finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.&quot; | Conditional Statement / If-Statement: A statement that affects the sequence of control by executing certain statements depending on the value of a boolean. | . Conditional Statements in JavaScript . Below is an example of an algorithm in JavaScript that uses selection: . function isEven(parameter) { if (parameter % 2 == 0) { console.log(&quot;The number is even.&quot;); } else if (parameter % 2 != 0) { console.log(&quot;The number is odd.&quot;) } } isEven(4) . Cell In[23], line 1 function isEven(parameter) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . A computer science student such as yourself will see conditional statements in JavaScript a lot. Below is an example of one in action: . if (30 == 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is true&quot;) } . Cell In[5], line 1 if (30 == 7) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . That is one conditional statement, but this algorithm is too simple to have anything done with it. Below is an algorithm building on the previous algorithm: . if (30 == 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is true&quot;) } else if (30 != 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is false&quot;) } . Cell In[21], line 1 if (30 == 7) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Conditional statements can be used for many a purpose. The algorithm above was quite simple, but conditionals can be found in more complex algorithms. . Binary Numbers . Let&#39;s do some truth tables! . Speed round . Challenges . Challenges Related to the Lesson That I Solved Myself . Note: I did these in Python . Level I: Vowel Count . Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string. We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this challenge (but not y). The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces. . Hint: If you use a lot of if-statements and there are more than one outcome, that is to be expected. If not, don&#39;t panic, just keep trying. . Level II: Who Likes It? . You probably know the &quot;like&quot; system from Facebook and other pages. People can &quot;like&quot; blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item. . Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples: . [] --&gt; &quot;no one likes this&quot; . [&quot;Peter&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Peter likes this&quot; . [&quot;Jacob&quot;, &quot;Alex&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Jacob and Alex like this&quot; . [&quot;Max&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Max, John and Mark like this&quot; . [&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Jacob&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Max&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this&quot; . Note: For 4 or more names, the number in &quot;and 2 others&quot; simply increases. . Hint: This requires you to combine knowledge on lists along with the conditionals you learned in this lesson. . Level III: Mutliples of 3 or 5 . If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. . Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them). . Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. . Hint: What do you know about for loops? Since your code incorporates a list of numbers from 1 to the max number, can you use for loops along with conditionals? . Level IV: Likes vs. Dislikes . YouTube had a like and a dislike button, which allowed users to express their opinions about particular content. It was set up in such a way that you cannot like and dislike a video at the same time. There are two other interesting rules to be noted about the interface: Pressing a button, which is already active, will undo your press. If you press the like button after pressing the dislike button, the like button overwrites the previous &quot;Dislike&quot; state. The same is true for the other way round. . Create a function that takes in a list of button inputs and returns the final state. . Examples: . /* like_or_dislike([Dislike]) ➞ Dislike like_or_dislike([Like, Like]) ➞ Nothing like_or_dislike([Dislike, Like]) ➞ Like like_or_dislike([Like, Dislike, Dislike]) ➞ Nothing */ . Notes . If no button is currently active, return Nothing. | If the list is empty, return Nothing. | . Hint: This is like level III, but harder, so don&#39;t give up! . Level V: Find the Odd Number . Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times. . There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times. . Examples: . [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd). . [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd). . [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd). . [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd). . [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd). . Hint: This is by far the hardest challenge out of all of these, in my opinion, and it took me about 3 or 4 months to solve this one. .

Lesson 3.7 James . Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements | they&#39;re nested one inside the other | An else if inside of another else if | Can be used for a varying amount of &quot;else if statements.&quot; The first if statement can represent if two coditions are true. The first else if can represent if only one or the other is true. The last else if represents if neither of the conditions are true. | Can have three different conditions | . Take aways . Learn how to determine the result of nested condtional statements | Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements | One condition leads to check in a second condition | . Writing Nested Conditional Statements . Can be planned and writen out first | Flow chart is a possibility. Ask a question. If the statement is false end the flowchart with one result. If it is true then repeat the process once more. | If (condition 1) | { first block of statements | . | } | else | { IF (condition 2) | { second block of statements | . | } | . | } | . this statement is false make a new result. Finally if the statement is true make a final result . Question 1 . Look at the following code . what happens when x is 5 and y becomes 4? Is the output same or change? | . x = 2 y = 3 if x == y: print(&quot;x and y are equal&quot;) else: if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is bigger than y&quot;) elif x &lt; y: print(&quot;x is smaller than y&quot;) . Question 2 . How much it will be cost when the height will be 60, age is 17, and photo taken? | when this person came after 1 year how much it will be cost? | . height = int(input(&quot;Welcom to the rollercoaster! nWhat is your height in Inch? &quot;)) age = int(input(&quot;What is your age?&quot;)) if height &lt; 48 : print(&quot;Can&#39;t ride&quot;) elif age &lt; 12 : photo = input(&quot;Adult tickets are $5 nDo you want a photo taken?

Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 . Quiz (Part of Hacks) . Complete this quiz: . questionNum = 3 correct = 0 questions = [ &quot;What is are correct names for a procedure? n A) Method n B) Function n C) Both&quot;, &quot;What is a procedure? n A) Sequencing n B) Selection n C) Iteration n D) All&quot;, &quot;Use this for following question: n def inchesToFeet(lengthInches): n t lengthFeet = lengthInches / 12 n t return lengthFeet n n What is the procedure name, the parameter, and what the procedure returns? n A) feetToInches, lengthInches, lengthMeters n B) inchesToFeet, lengthInches, lengthFeet n C) inchesToFeet, lengthFeet, lengthInches n D) lengthInches, inchesToFeet, lengthFeet&quot;] answers = [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] def qna(question, answer): print(&quot;Question:&quot;, question) response = input() print(&quot;Answer:&quot;, response) if response.lower() == answer: print(&quot;Correct :) n&quot;) global correct correct += 1 else: print(&quot;Incorrect :( n&quot;) for x in range(questionNum): qna(questions[x], answers[x]) print(&quot;Score:&quot;, correct, &quot;/ 3&quot;) . Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . Ex: . def divide(num1,num2): x = num1/num2 return x . what is x being assigned to inside the function? . | As a reminder, to use function parameters, you would have to write the syntax name of the function followed by the parameters needed in parentheses . | Function parameters are the parameters that are used when calling the function in order to get a result. . | . What are the function parameters in this procedure? . What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. . What is wrong with the function? . Can you translate the binary numbers into decimal notation? . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: None Cube: None . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool? &quot; a_count = count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s) d_count = count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s) print(&quot;Words starting with a:&quot;, a_count) print(&quot;Words starting with d:&quot;, d_count) . Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguments that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; .

            "content": "Unit 3.9 . 3.9.1 Algorithms (Claire) . A little review on Algorithms: . what are the three components of an algorithm? . sel__ | seq__ | it___ | . Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;You failed&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? You failed . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . Why is this important? . When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code!

Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 .

            "content": "Unit 3, Section 1.1: Data Types and Variables - Ederick . Essential Knowledge (College Board&#39;s Must Knows): . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than antoher. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as &quot;containers&quot; and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of &quot;Alex.&quot; How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . x = &quot;alex&quot; print(x) . alex . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named &quot;age&quot; becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . Example: . age = &quot;Timmy&quot; name = &quot;25&quot; print(name + &quot; is &quot; + age) . 25 is Timmy . Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion | . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone&#39;s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): .

Determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment . done through looking at how we can use the assignment operator | . Note: . Collegeboard uses &lt;-- as the assignment operator . The assignment operator looks different for different types of coding languages A variable will take the most recent value assigned | . How do you even store a value inside a variable? . Let&#39;s use python for our example: . In python, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=) | In order to store a value inside a variable, we must: Give the variable a name | place the assignment operator | input the variable value | . | . highscore = 100 # How do you store a number like 3.72? money = 3.72 # What about storing your username (string)? username = &quot;name&quot; # What if it is raining outside and you want to store that fact (boolean)? is_raining = True # What about a list of groceries? groceries = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;flour&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;] .

Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths. | The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. | The user does not need to know how the list stores data (this gives way for data abstraction). | . In the code below, the logic itself works with a list, but the code abstracts it into a sequence of bits in a string (as seen in the input and output). To make this work, the splitbits lists is created and processed. At the end of the code, the result is outputted as a string rather than a list (abstraction). . bits = input(&quot;Input a sequence of bits to invert: &quot;) splitbits = list(bits) for i in range(len(splitbits)): if splitbits[i] == &#39;0&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;1&#39; elif splitbits[i] == &#39;1&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;0&#39; print(&quot;&quot;.join(splitbits)) .

Managing Complexity with lists - Liav . Long and slow way . By now, everyone should know the &quot;long and slow way&quot; to print a list of something in python It is easy to just assign a value to a single variable | This method is displayed in this example with test scores: | . | . score1 = 95 score2 = 24 score3 = 87 score4 = 92 print(score1, score2, score3, score4) . As you can see, each score is assigned to its relative variable such as &quot;score1 = 95&quot; and then you just print each variable. | However you can make the code segment faster, easier to read, and more efficient... | . Assinging values to one variable . Use square brackets &quot;[]&quot; to store the values of a certain variable, then you can simply print the variable to output your desired list: | . scores = [95, 24, 87, 92] print(scores) . Now instead of having a difference variable and new line of code for each value, the list is simply displayed by assigning each value to a single value that you can now print. | . How lists manage complexity of a program . Simplification . It is much simpler, faster, and easier to code lists this way | Makes the code segment much easier to read | . | Variables . You do not need as many variables, because you can just assign all corresponding values to a single variable | To change a value you don&#39;t have to edit/add/remove an entire variable | . | .

In this data example, we are going to make &quot;the best computer jokes ever ;)&quot; and serve them over the Internet. The ultimate objective is to allow our viewers to provide a like or dislike on each of our jokes. . This code planning begins by coming up with some jokes and defining a data &quot;model&quot; to keep and manage the jokes. . jokes_data contains a list of dictionary records containing joke and reactions:haha or boohoo - joke_list contains collection of jokes we will put into jokes_data | . | Next comes some functions to interact with our jokes . def initJokes(): initializes jokes_data | def getJokes(): returns the complete list of jokes | def getJoke(): returns a single joke from our list | ... many more function can be examined by reading comments below ... | . | . import random jokes_data = [] joke_list = [ &quot;If you give someone a program... you will frustrate them for a day; if you teach them how to program... you will &quot; &quot;frustrate them for a lifetime.&quot;, &quot;Q: Why did I divide sin by tan?

An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

Events are triggered by some action, which usually send user input to the program. . Input usually affects the output. . How does a program know what to do upon and event? . Action may be initiated by the user or another program. . In event driven programming program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control. . Input can come from a user or other programs . Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. . Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state. .

It&#39;s a great first language for web developers to learn. . W3Schools - reference | feecodecamp.org - pbl . | javascript30.com - pbl . | . console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher); // before role logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // ok to do this even though role is not yet defined // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // set the role logItType(teacher); logItType(teacher.toJSON()); . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;&#34;} object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Hobby:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Hobby&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Antony Yu Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 12 Cars: rav4 Antony Yu Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 12 Cars: rav4 . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Hobby:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Hobby&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Antony Yu Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 12 Cars: rav4 Antony Yu Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 12 Cars: rav4 . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints... Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set? Could you do it with input? | Make a quiz that stores in a List of Dictionaries. | . | .",
