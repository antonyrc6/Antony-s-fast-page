### Student 1 Grade

| Category                     | Student Score | Collegeboard score | Comment                                                                  |
|------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1             | 0                  | I thought the program purpose was shown in the written response.         |
| Data Abstraction             | 1             | 1                  | The data abstraction was shown in his code.                              |
| Managing Complexity          | 1             | 0                  | I thought the complexity in his code is pretty good                       |
| Procedural Abstraction       | 1             | 1                  | The process shown all the necessary item and no extra.                   |
| Algorithm Implementation     | 1             | 1                  | The algorithm is efficient in their codes shown in the written response. |
| Testing                      | 1             | 1                  | The testing is success and give all the result needed.                   |

|------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1             | 1                  | The student describe the purpose in the written response.                                                |
| Data Abstraction             | 1             | 1                  | The list is used in the student's datas in the written response.                                         |
| Managing Complexity          | 0             | 1                  | I think the student's codes were long and complex, but it turns out that those were the necessary codes. |
| Procedural Abstraction       | 1             | 1                  | The process of the student's program is shown complete and simple.                                       |
| Algorithm Implementation     | 1             | 1                  | The student describe how his algorithm works in the written response.                                    |
| Testing                      | 1             | 1                  | The student test many scenarios of how the program is going to work.                                     |
