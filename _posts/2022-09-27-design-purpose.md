### Computing Innovation
##### 1.The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
##### 2.An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovations.

### Categories of Innovations
##### -Games     -Social Media     -Business     -Productivity
##### -Computers -Smart phones     -Wearable
##### -Ecommerce -Cloud services   -Email

> Social medias and applications allow users to connect from distance and achieve activity.
> E-commerce allow users to shop at home.
> Digital assistance device allow user to control device hand-free.

#### The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or pursue interest through creative expression.

#### Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms:
##### tactile (touch), audio, visual, text.

> Most programs are written in an event driven environment.

##### Events are triggered by some action, which usually send user input to the program.

##### Input usually affects the output.

#### How does a program know what to do upon and event?
##### Action may be initiated by the user or another program.

#### In event driven programming program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control.
#### Input can come from a user or other programs
#### Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device.

#### Program output is usually based on a program's input or prior state.

### What is a program
#### A program is a collection of statements.
##### A statement is a single command.
##### A group of statement is called a code segment.
##### Code segment are executed according to the rules of the programming language.
##### A program is often referred.

#### Code segment are texts and blocks.

##### A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software.
##### A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.
##### A program needs to work for a variety of input and situations.
##### The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.
##### A program can be described broadly by what is does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function.
