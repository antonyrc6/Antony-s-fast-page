##### A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.
##### A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.
##### A run-time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program.
##### An overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values.

> Errors and programming go hand in hand

#### Programmers are constantly running into errors when they program

##### In fact, it is an expectation that errors are a part of the programming process.
##### Proficient programmers can identify errors as one of the following types:
###### logic error, syntax error, runtime error, overflow error.

##### Logic error is caused by the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm which causes by program to behave unexpectedly
