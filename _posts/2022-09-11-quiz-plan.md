> I'll be planning my quiz questions here

### 1.Find the missing length using pythagroean theorem
### 2.Find the limit of f(x)
### 3.Find the maximum value of the graph
### 4.Find the limit of f(x)

# College Board Create Performance Task
### Step 1: program purpose and function
#### The purpose of the quiz is to improve a student's math skill.
### Step 2: data abstraction
#### The code.org does not involve data abstraction because the codes are already covert to blocks.
### Step 3: managing complexity
#### Data abstraction make coding easier for coders. In code.org, user simply drag and drop, list will be not necessary.
### Step 4: procedural abstraction
#### Procedural abstraction allows coder to type less code. For example, you are typing a repeating code for many times, it can be replace with less codes.
### Step 5: algorithm implementation
#### In my code.org quiz, I use sequencing because all the events go in order.
### Step 6: testing
#### I test my quiz by running the program. On each page, I check all the buttons to ensure they lead to the correct page. Last, I check the console log to see if they display the correct thing.
