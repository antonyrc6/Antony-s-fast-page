##### There are multiple development processed like investigation, designing, prototyping, and testing.
##### A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection.
##### A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works.
##### Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints.

##### Developer follow steps and stick with plan.
##### Development is exploratory.

> Testing
#### Developers test the program every step of the way.
#### Testing occurs at
##### -Micro level
##### -Macro level
#### Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection
