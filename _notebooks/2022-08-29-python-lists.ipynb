    "As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week.  <mark>Variables all have a type</mark>: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types.  In Python, variables are given a type at assignment,  Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections.  Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection.  \n",
    "2. Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output."

The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts.  Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so."
